# Urdu Spell Checker

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/w19ggs0o8v8v0a4r?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/umerfaruk/spellchecker)

The purpose of this repository is to create a spell check that would give recommendations for a list of corrections for common mistakes a user makes while typing urdu unicode text. 

Some example of these corrections can be following:

1. Incorrect unicode character used. e.g. confusion between similar looking characters between urdu, arabic and persian language like 'ہ'، 'ک'.
2. Common typing mistakes due to incorrect or limited keyboard usage. e.g. ؤ  and ئو۔
3۔ Common mistakes in language. e.g. incorrect usage of ذ and ز۔

and this list is ever growing. 

## How to suggest correction.
